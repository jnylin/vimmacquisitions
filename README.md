Creating acquisition lists from CSV files created by BOOK-IT

# Save files from BOOK-IT in the csv directory
Use Catalogue - Lists in BOOK-IT to generate the data. Use Ctrl + Alt + S to save the hit list as a CSV file. Save the file as ++section++.csv in the csv directory.

If there's any non-latin characters in the hit list you need to copy to hit list and manually save a CSV file that is encoded with UTF-8. Save the file as ++section_utf++.csv in the csv directory.
